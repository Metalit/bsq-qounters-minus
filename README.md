# Qounters-

Store brand version of [*Counters+*](https://github.com/Caeden117/CountersPlus) for the Oculus Quest version of Beat Saber. Adds a variety of configurable ~~Counters~~ Qounters to display statistics in-game.

Configure your Qounters from the Mod Settings menu (Main menu → Settings (gear icon) → Mod Settings → Qounters-)

Settings can be loaded from a *Counters+* configuration file! Rename your `CountersPlus.json` to `qounters-minus.json` and upload it through BMBF's Upload screen after installing Qounters-.

Everything covered by the original base mod is supported, *except*:
- The settings menu is store brand
- Separate canvases are not supported

---

If Qounters- is failing to load, make sure it is the most recently enabled mod in BMBF by disabling and re-enabling it.

*Today's interface has been brought to you by the letter **Q***.
