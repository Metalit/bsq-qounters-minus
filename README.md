# Qounters-

Cheap knockoff of Counters+ for Quest

## Implemented Qounters
- Cut
- Miss
- Notes
- NotesLeft
- Spinometer
- Speed

## Unimplemented Qounters
- Fail
- PB
- Progress
- Score

## TODO before release
- do qounters actually need to be destroyed? or remove existing destroy shell
- qounter sizing with regard to vertical layout group (how to force expand when e.g. multiple lines? cut qounter, speed qounter, etc.)
- parent container alignment (grow top to bottom, not from center)
- fine tune parent container locations
- add distance option to each? maybe
- pull options menu hover texts from original counters+
